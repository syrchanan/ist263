            <h1>Collecting Viewership Data</h1>

                <p>
                    It might seem easy to collect data for television ratings, but the process is more complex than
                    meets
                    the eye. To start, it must be mentioned that the United States is split into DMAs, or Designated
                    Market
                    Areas, for ratings. Since national ratings have been the focus, it will remain there, but these DMAs
                    are
                    still relevant. Each DMA is focused around a major city or a general area – such as New York City or
                    Quincy-Hannibal-Keokuk. Within each area, it would be impractical to track the viewership of every
                    single person, so agencies like Nielsen will create a sample group known as a panel. Panelists are
                    invite-only, since the sample group are specially created in order to match the overall demographics
                    of
                    the area as closely as possible.

                <h2>Collection</h2>
                <p>
                    Once the panel has been made, it is time to collect the actual information of what they are
                    watching. In
                    the past, Nielsen has had the panelists record (by hand in a diary) what they had watched and for
                    how
                    long. This process is slow, both in collecting and processing, so it was recently discarded in favor
                    of
                    all digital alternatives. However, it did give rise to a focused measurement known as “books”. In
                    the
                    past, four times a year the smallest local stations would receive ratings during these periods
                    (February, May, July, and November). These ratings were referred to as books (the November book, the
                    May
                    book, etc.), because they were the only times the diaries would be collected.

                <p>
                    Now, Nielsen has upgraded to using various digital devices. In the top 56 DMAs (top being the
                    largest),
                    the panelists use “People Meters” (variations seen above) and “Set Meters”. These are devices which
                    attach directly to the panelists’ television, measuring all video content that is played on it. In
                    the
                    next 14 largest DMAs, panelists are equipped with “Code Readers”, which are similar in design, but
                    they
                    sit next to the TV rather than be plugged in. The underlying technology that each of the readers and
                    meters use to log viewing is quite interesting. When a TV channel is played on a TV, there is a
                    sound
                    (which cannot be heard by humans) that when decoded, tells the reader or meter which channel is
                    being
                    played. This information, when used in tandem with lists of what each channel is playing in a given
                    day,
                    can be used to figure out exactly what each panelist is watching! The rest of the DMAs are sourced
                    from
                    satellite and cable providers, who anonymize the data before sending it on to Nielsen, so there are
                    fewer demographics available for study in these markets.
