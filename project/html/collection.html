            <h3>Designated Market Areas</h3>
            <p>
                It might seem easy to collect data for television ratings, but the process is more complex than meets
                the eye. To start, it must be mentioned that the United States is split into DMAs, or Designated Market
                Areas, for ratings. Since national ratings have been the focus, it will remain there, but these DMAs are
                still relevant. Each DMA is focused around a major city or a general area – such as New York City or
                Quincy-Hannibal-Keokuk. Within each area, it would be impractical to track the viewership of every
                single person, so agencies like Nielsen will create a sample group known as a panel. Panelists are
                invite-only, since the sample group are specially created in order to match the overall demographics of
                the area as closely as possible.

            <h3>Collection</h3>
            <p>
                Once the panel has been made, it is time to collect the actual information of what they are watching. In
                the past, Nielsen has had the panelists record (by hand in a diary) what they had watched and for how
                long. This process is slow, both in collecting and processing, so it was recently discarded in favor of
                all digital alternatives. However, it did give rise to a focused measurement known as “books”. In the
                past, four times a year the smallest local stations would receive ratings during these periods
                (February, May, July, and November). These ratings were referred to as books (the November book, the May
                book, etc.), because they were the only times the diaries would be collected.

            <p>
                Now, Nielsen has upgraded to using various digital devices. In the top 56 DMAs (top being the largest),
                the panelists use “People Meters” (variations seen above) and “Set Meters”. These are devices which
                attach directly to the panelists’ television, measuring all video content that is played on it. In the
                next 14 largest DMAs, panelists are equipped with “Code Readers”, which are similar in design, but they
                sit next to the TV rather than be plugged in. The underlying technology that each of the readers and
                meters use to log viewing is quite interesting. When a TV channel is played on a TV, there is a sound
                (which cannot be heard by humans) that when decoded, tells the reader or meter which channel is being
                played. This information, when used in tandem with lists of what each channel is playing in a given day,
                can be used to figure out exactly what each panelist is watching! The rest of the DMAs are sourced from
                satellite and cable providers, who anonymize the data before sending it on to Nielsen, so there are
                fewer demographics available for study in these markets.
