            <h3>Types of Reports</h3>
            <p>
                News and entertainment networks depend totally on receiving ratings data in order to sell advertising,
                and therefore keep their organization profitable. However, raw data doesn’t help when trying to sell
                ratings to advertisers – that’s where research teams come in. These teams are typically comprised of
                data analysts, data scientists, and database managers, all of whom deal directly with the ratings data
                as they come in. They all collaborate to work on two general kinds of reports that need to be sent out:
                daily and ad hoc.

            <h3>Daily Reports</h3>
            <p>
                Daily reporting involves comparing the network to others similar to it, as well as daily trends. For
                example, if a new show is launched, a timeslot is moved, or an anchor is changed, those who make
                business decisions at the network will want to know how those alterations are playing out in the eyes of
                viewers. If ratings increase over time, then they can definitively say that was a successful change,
                while the inverse is also true. Additionally, if a competitor changes their lineup somehow, it’s best
                practice to monitor how viewers react to those changes, since other networks may want to consider
                matching those alterations. Daily trends are a little different, where the analysts check to see which
                networks had the highest viewership day-over-day. Using these statistics, many different conclusions can
                be drawn, not the least of which is checking breaking news or premieres. For example, the day of the
                Capitol Insurrection, CNN led cable network coverage with a Live + SD total of around 6 million
                different viewers, whereas MSNBC saw 4.5 million and FOX only 3.5 million.

            <p>
                In the image below, there is a sampling of just some of the networks that may be compared. However,
                there are two types of television networks that come in to play here: broadcast and cable. While they do
                eventually report the same ratings data,there is a slight delay for companies receiving the broadcast
                network data. Out of the ones below, the largest broadcast networks are: ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Note
                that while many of these have cables alternatives (Fox News, MSNBC, etc.), these four are still
                broadcast networks.

            <h3>Ad Hoc Reports</h3>
            <p>
                Ad hoc reporting is slightly different, only in that it is not a regular report that is being sent out.
                Instead, the analysts get a request from elsewhere in the organization (producers, reporters, marketing,
                C-level, etc.) for an analysis of the ratings of a specific program or block of time. This way, specific
                analyses can be run on an individual basis, clearing the way for a more granular focus to be taken. One
                metric typically included in this analysis is known as “P4” and “Quarter Lead”. P4 is the gathering of
                the ratings from the previous four weeks that match the timeslot and day that the program in question
                does. This helps to give an overview of a short-term trend for the program, because a lot can change
                over the course of four weeks. The quarter lead is when the ratings are gathered from the last 15
                minutes (quarter hour) before the program in question starts. This metric illustrates how well a certain
                show is able to hold on to viewers that already are watching the channel. Using these different methods,
                a zoomed in focus can be taken of specific programs.
