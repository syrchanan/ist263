            <h1>TV Ratings</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>What are they?</h2>
                <p>
                    Ratings play a pivotal role in the television landscape – whether it is recognized or not. They
                    provide
                    the foundation for all advertising, and therefore all the money, in the industry. When collected,
                    they
                    can provide insight to different demographics of people and their viewing habits. For example, an
                    advertiser may want to target 25–54-year-olds across the country, so they will use ratings to
                    determine
                    which network offers them the biggest group of 25–54-year-olds to reach. In this way, ratings
                    provide
                    the backbone of all television; without them, it would be much harder for news and entertainment
                    companies to make money on TV.

                <h2>Contents of a Ratings Report</h2>
                <p>
                    Measurement for television ratings can be a little tricky, so let’s break it down. When a ratings
                    report
                    is sent to the different national cable networks, they receive information about 10 different
                    categories. Local TV is measured slightly differently, so we’ll just focus on national ratings for
                    the
                    time being. The reported metrics are the: Demographic Group, Playback Period, Projections*, Share*
                    (%),
                    Reach* (%), Average Minute Audience^ (%), Average Commercial Minute^ (%), and Time Spent. Those
                    marked
                    with an asterisk are generally indicators of how many people are watching, and those marked with a
                    caret
                    are indicators of the actual ratings.

                    This all sounds great in theory, but what exactly do the television networks see when the ratings
                    are
                    delivered? An example rating might read:
                </p>
                <!-- I am still noting the differences with characters (* and ^) for now until we can use CSS for styling -->

                <h2>Breaking It Down</h2>
                <p>
                    Now let’s work through it, metric by metric. To start, the demographic group in the rating is “P2+”,
                    meaning they are tracking how everyone who is two or older interacted with the program. Other
                    popular
                    demographics are 25-54, as well as 18-34, but they can be adjusted to whatever age range suits the
                    network. Next, the playback period is showing “Live + SD”, meaning that this measurement includes
                    anyone
                    who watched the program live or later the same day. There are other options for playback, such as
                    “Live
                    + 7” (anyone who watched it live or within the following seven days). Every other statistic
                    following
                    will only account for the people who meet these two categories, so it’s easiest to think of them as
                    subdivisions.

            <section>
                <p>
                    The “How Many” group of measurements consists of Projections, Share, and Reach – let’s dive in.
                    Projections are measure how many people watched an average minute of the program. This measurement
                    is
                    delivered in thousands, so the real number is actually 8,764,000, but it is the raw number of
                    viewers.
                    Next, Share relates how many people who were watching TV at the time, decided to tune in to the
                    program.
                    In our example, a share of 10.83% means 10.83% of all people watching TV viewed the program in
                    question.
                    Reach is identical to Share, except it doesn’t require that they be watching TV at the time, so it
                    includes all the extended viewing. In our example, the playback period is “Live + SD”, so only the
                    live
                    viewers are included in the Share, but the Same Day viewers are added into the Reach measurement.

                    The actual ratings themselves are not too tough to understand, once past the rest of the statistics.
                    The
                    first is Average Minute Audience, which is the percentage of people in the demographic who tuned in
                    to
                    an average minute of the program. In the example, this stat is 3.1%, meaning of all people age two
                    or
                    older, 3.1% of them tuned into the program during the playback period. Next is Average Commercial
                    Minute, which is the same as the previous, except dealing with commercials rather than the program
                    itself. This is typically lower than the average minute audience, as it is in the example, because
                    viewers will tend to change channels during commercial breaks rather than during the program. The
                    last
                    measure in the example is Time Spent, which is simply an average amount of time that viewers spent
                    watching the program. For the example, viewers tuned in for an average of 23 minutes, which is about
                    right for a half hour program (there is typically 22 minutes of content and eight minutes of
                    commercials
                    in a half-hour show).
