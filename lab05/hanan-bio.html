        <p>
            I am pursuing a double major, studying both broadcast journalism and data analytics. I am interested in conducting broadcast research on linear TV cable networks. 
        </p>

        <p>
            To this end, I have become experienced using Microsoft Excel, R, <strong>Shiny Apps</strong>, and other interactive tools to leverage data and find the stories beyond just the TV ratings.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the past I have worked on various projects, including:

        <h2>Personal Info</h2>

        <p>
        Outside of work, I can often be found playing water polo, bodysurfing at the beach, reminiscing about moving to the opposite coast, or slipping ‘Seinfeld’ references into normal conversation.
