        I am pursuing a double major, studying both broadcast journalism and data analytics. I am interested in conducting broadcast research on linear TV cable networks. To this end, I have become experienced using Microsoft Excel, R, Shiny Apps, and other interactive tools to leverage data and find the stories beyond just the TV ratings. Outside of work, I can often be found playing water polo, bodysurfing at the beach, or slipping ‘Seinfeld’ references into normal conversation.
